# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains applied machine learning notebooks that focus on customer analytics,
predictive modeling, and unsupervised learning techniques.
The projects demonstrate end-to-end workflows including data preparation, modeling,
evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Notebook 1: Customer Churn Analysis
**File:** `Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`

**Goal:**  
Analyze customer behavior and build predictive models to identify customers at risk of churn.

**Focus:**
- Understanding drivers of customer churn
- Predicting churn probability using supervised learning
- Evaluating model performance with appropriate metrics

**What’s inside:**
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Classification models (e.g. Logistic Regression, tree-based models)
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC, and AUC
- Interpretation of model results and business implications

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Supervised machine learning
- Classification modeling and evaluation
- Translating model outputs into actionable insights
- Structured analytical reasoning

## Notebook 2: Clustering and Recommendation Systems
**File:** `Clustering_and_Recommendation_Systems.ipynb`

**Goal:**  
Apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns in user behavior and build recommendation logic.

**Focus:**
- Customer / user segmentation using clustering
- Similarity-based recommendation approaches
- Hybrid recommendation concepts

**What’s inside:**
- Clustering methods (e.g. k-means or similar approaches)
- Feature representation for users and items
- User-based and item-based similarity using cosine similarity
- Hybrid recommendation logic combining multiple signals

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Unsupervised machine learning
- Clustering and similarity-based modeling
- Recommendation system fundamentals
- Practical application of distance and similarity metrics
